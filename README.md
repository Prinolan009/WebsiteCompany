# Website
This is a typical website created using ASP.net (Framework 3.5). Given the time frame I chose to leave out certain functionalities which could have improved the website. The website was built on Visual studio 2010 and used SQL 2014 as the database. Whomever runs this website may encounter an error with regards to registering or logging into the website as I used a local database which is only accessible from my machine.

Hopefully this wont be a big issue, as I was not really sure as to how I can relay my database when you'll test this website. I have commented my code where necessary.

In addition I did incoporate Javascript for some functionality pertaining to the menu, and CSSfor styling pages.

The following website allows a user to
- Register
- Login
- View their details
- View the goods being sold
- Review the about and contact pages
- Purchase goods (Shopping cart)
- And finally review their purchase history.

If there are any issues please contact me via email - prinolan009@gmail.com
